# Testing RTS,S strategies using `malariasimulation` :syringe: :mosquito: :earth_africa:

## Summary
Recent roll-out of the RTS,S malaria vaccine in Ghana, Kenya, and Malawi was accomplished through the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Children received three doses of RTS,S as they reached specified ages (e.g. 6, 7.5, and 9 months), followed by a fourth booster dose 18 months after receiving the intial regimen. Seasonal mass vaccination campaigns have also been successfully tested in Mali and Burkina Faso, where children ages 5-17 months were given the first three RTS,S doses immediately preceeding the high transmission season, followed by fourth and fifth doses 1 and 2 years later, respectively. Here we create and test a hybrid strategy which delivers the first three doses through an EPI program, and two booster doses timed seasonally to be given right before the annual high transmission season.

## Objectives
1. Compare this hybrid strategy to standard EPI and seasonal vaccination strategies by measuring intervention efficacy. :chart_with_upwards_trend: 

2. Explore the minimum gap between receiving the 3rd dose and the first booster dose under the hybrid strategy. :eyes:

3. Explore the advantages of adding a 5th dose. :syringe::syringe::syringe::syringe::syringe:

4. Determine the coverage achieved (% vaccinated) under EPI vs. mass vaccination settings. :bar_chart: :family_man_woman_girl_boy:

5. Measure the relative cost-effectiveness of investing in ITNs vs. RTS,S. :heavy_dollar_sign:
